<a href="#overview" class="anchor"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>This vignette demonstrates how to intersect spatial and gridded data, aggregating values by spatial polygon. This is useful when creating summary statistics at the state or county level. These statistics can then be presenteted as a table or as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">chloropleth map</a>.</p>
<p>This technique uses <em>sp</em> style spatial objects and is for those already familiar with the <em>MazamaSpatialUtils</em> package.</p>
<div id="spatial-data-setup" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#spatial-data-setup" class="anchor"></a>Spatial data setup</h3>
<p>The <em>MazamaSpatialUtils</em> package is already a requirement for <em>AirFireModeling</em> and is therefore already installed. We will use datasets named <code>USCensusStates</code> and <code>USCensusCounties</code>. Each of these is an <em>sp</em> package <code>SpatialPolygonsDataFrame</code> (SPDF). These are “S4” objects with per-polygon data stored in the <code>@data</code> slot.</p>
